## Abstract
Rocket Pool has, at times, been criticized for moving too slowly. A significant component of this is due to community discussion, consensus building, compromising, and other such social friction. This RPIP proposes to cut the Gordian Knot by simply declaring a God Emperor that will decree our direction.

Unfortunately, knoshua, the proposed God Emperor, has publicly declared their lack of interest in the position. To that end, we will select a group of [Imperial Inquisitors](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Inquisitor). These Inquisitors will be in charge of determining and distilling every imperial whim and desire into proper imperial decrees.

## Specification
- knoshua SHALL be declared God Emperor
- All future documents in this repository SHALL be Rocket Pool Imperial Decrees (RPIDs) instead of Rocket Pool Improvement Proposals (RPIPs)
  - RPIDs SHALL not be voted on 
  - RPIDs SHALL immediately be in force upon finalization
  - Any community member acting or speaking out against RPIDs SHALL be excommunicated; this includes penalizing their node for the maximum amount, force exiting all validators possible, banning from forums, banning from discord, and any other punishments deemed suitable by the God Emperor or the Inquisitors.
- The Imperial Inquisitors SHALL have the following duties
  - Collecting and archiving all communications from the God Emperor
  - Discussing how best to distill the God Emperor's whims and desires into RPIDs
  - Drafting RPIDs
  - Enforcing the God Emperor's desires, as established by RPIDs, upon the community and any others that stand in the way of the God Emperor's vision
- The God Emperor MAY overrule any decision by the Imperial Inquisitors
- The God Emperor MAY remove any Imperial Inquisitor
  - Any Inquisitor so removed SHALL be excommunicated
- Any time there are fewer than 5 Imperial Inquisitors, the pDAO SHALL select a full slate of 7 Imperial Inquisitors following the selection process in [RPIP-10](RPIP-10.md#management-committee-selection)
  - This SHALL be the only governance role served by the pDAO

## Risks
Absolutely none. Nothing could go wrong.

## Additional thoughts
Obviously, this is a joke, and not a real proposal.
